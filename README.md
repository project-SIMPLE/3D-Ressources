3D Ressources




This repository contains shared 3D and Unity assets for the SIMPLE VR project.

It is used to store and reuse assets across different virtual worlds and
experiences developed with Unity.

Content may include 3D models, prefabs, materials, textures, and other
resources optimized for virtual reality.

Assets are intended to be imported into SIMPLE Unity projects and reused
when building or prototyping VR environments.
